# CareerHub API - Assignment 1.1

## Architecture Choice
    Used Minimal APIs instead of Controllers. For 2 simple read-only endpoints, Minimal APIs have less boilerplate, faster startup, and are the recommended approach in .NET 10. Controllers would add unnecessary abstraction.

## How to Run
    1. `dotnet restore`
    2. `dotnet run`
    3. Open the Scalar UI URL shown in terminal, usually https://localhost:7227/scalar/v1

## Endpoints
    - GET /jobs - returns all job listings
    - GET /jobs/{id} - returns one job or 404 if not found
